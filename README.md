#   Bike Sharing Usage Analysis (JCDecaux API)

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** using real-time bike-sharing data from the **JCDecaux public API**, with **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}** as the case study.

It covers **planning, live data collection, and exploratory analysis**, aligned with an academic analytics assignment.

---

## 🔹 Task 1 – Analysis Planning
- Defined key questions and hypotheses around bike and stand availability
- Focused on temporal patterns (time of day, weekdays vs weekends)
- Identified indicators of high-demand and underutilized stations

---

## 🔹 Task 2 – Real-Time Data Collection
- Integrated the JCDecaux API using Python
- Automated data fetching every **20 minutes**
- Stored station-level snapshots with timestamps
- Built a **time-series dataset** from live urban mobility data

---

## 🔹 Task 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis
- Cleaned and preprocessed API data using **pandas** and **numpy**
- Analyzed bike and stand availability trends over time
- Compared weekday vs weekend usage patterns
- Identified demand imbalances and operational inefficiencies
- Linked findings back to the original hypotheses

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Is Relevant
- Demonstrates working with **live APIs**
- Shows automated data pipelines and time-based analysis
- Applies EDA to answer **real-world mobility questions**
- Approach is transferable to smart cities, transport, and sustainability analytics
